# LOT (Linux Observability Tool : Lots of Tools)

## Motivation
lot is planned to be a command line utility that provides across the board logging and debugging options for processes and containers so that those can be assessed using a single entry and access point. 

The idea in lot (linux observability tools/lots of tools) is to aggregate existing functionalities to provide a single point of access to human debuggers. This should also be integratable in pipelines to provide relevant and (if specified actionable) information.
