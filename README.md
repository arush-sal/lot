# LOT (Linux observability Tool : Lots of Tools)

## Motivation

LoT is planned to be a command line utility that provides across the board logging and debugging options for processes and containers so that those can be assessed using a single entry and access point.

The idea in LoT (linux observability tools/lots of tools) is to aggregate existing functionalities to provide a single point of access to human debuggers. This should also be integratable in pipelines to provide relevant and (if specified actionable) information. In its whole the underlying tools and the work around them are inspired from awesome summarized Linux tools charts from [Brendan Gregg](http://brendangregg.com).

Maybe in future for tuning support we can consider [these](http://brendangregg.com/Perf/linux_tuning_tools.png) also.
